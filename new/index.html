                            COVID-2019.</span>
                        However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People
                        with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
                    </p>

                        symptoms while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other
                        people, until you have recovered.</p>

                                                        Why? </strong> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up
                                                    viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your
                                                    eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
                                                    can make you sick.

                                            <p>Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your
                                                normal body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the
                                                temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with
                                                extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to
                                                protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.
                                                By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid
                                                infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.

                                                is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets

                                                of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your
                                                hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap
                                                and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and
